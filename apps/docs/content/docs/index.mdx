# What is Lettera?

Lettera is a modern, open-source newsletter and subscriber management platform designed specifically for developers and creators who value ownership, performance, and simplicity.

We built Lettera because we were tired of bloated dashboards, confusing UIs, and closed ecosystems. We wanted a tool that felt fast, intuitive, and integrated seamlessly with our existing workflows.
